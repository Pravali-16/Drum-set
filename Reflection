today's reflection:- Today I was learnt how to create GitHub profile and i learnt about frontend and i was learnt about middleware,API, controller,database, driver and how we get respond from controller to API.
frontend:the application which appears on the browser is known as frontend 
API:its takes request from client
middleware: it checks the is the request is correct or not 
controller:it runs the code on server.controller takes database and gives respond.
gitpod.io:it is a server.
gitpod:it is a platform where we write the code.
In between controller and database driver acts as bridge.
operation in database:CRUD
C: create
R:read
U: update
D: delete
middleware, controller, database are server side
API:it is a client side
